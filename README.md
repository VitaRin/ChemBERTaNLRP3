<h3> ChemBERTaNLRP3 </h3>
<br>
This repository contains supplementary code material for the development of ChemBERTaNLRP3 model, a fine-tuned ChemBERTa model trained for classification of the activity of potenital NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors. 
<br>
The fine-tuned model can be found on the HuggingFace library here: https://huggingface.co/VitaRin/ChemBERTaNLRP3 
<br><br>
This repository includes the data used for training, a jupyter file that includes all data processing and training code, and a simple python script demonstrating the usage of the model.
